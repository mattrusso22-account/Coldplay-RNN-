# Coldplay-RNN-
This project involves Machine Learning Techniques on a Coldplay lyrical dataset. The dataset contains lyrics from a number of different Coldplays songs within his discography. We are using Recurrent Neural Networks to try and generate new lyrics that resemble how Coldplay writes. Selecting an appropriate number of paramters/hyperparamters and the suitable values within our network are critical to ensure success. Despite the dataset being on the smaller size, the hope is still to be able to identify the unique capabilites RNN has with sequential/time-series type data.
Follow the source code that explains how to execute each step. This will allow the audience to see the breakdown and start to finish process that I went through. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated if you see an opportunity / area where our model can learn/train better and where it would result in more effective lyrical generation. Thank you in advance!
