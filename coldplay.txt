Down here where I cannot see so clear?"
I said, "What do I know
Show me the right way to go"

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives
Look at the way we live
Down here I cannot sleep from fear no
I said, "Which way do I turn?"
Oh I forget everything I learn

And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no

They're gonna catch us where we sleep
Ah and if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so good 'cause you know
That those spies hide out in every corner
They can't touch you, no
'Cause they're just spies

And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know
You know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do

'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line

Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin

Look at the stars

And all the things that you do 
Oh no, I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

Oh no what's this
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turn to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Oh no, I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble

Singing that I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me 

In a haze, a stormy haze
I'll be round
I'll be loving you always, always
Here I am and I'll take my time
Here I am and I'll wait in line always
Always 

Can anybody fly this thing?
Before my head explodes
Or my head starts to ring

We've been living life inside a bubble
We've been living life inside a bubble

Confidence in you
Is confidence in me

Can anybody stop this thing?
Before my head explodes
Or my head starts to ring

And never be cruel

I wanna fly
And never come down
And live my life
And have friends around

We never change, do we?

So I wanna live in a wooden house
And making more friends would be easy

Oh and I don't have a soul to save
Yes and I sin every single day
We never change, do we?
We never learn, do we?

So I wanna live in a wooden house
Where making more friends would be easy
I wanna live where the sun comes out
When I counted up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
With the good ones on my shoulder
I drove the other ones away

So if you ever feel neglected
And if you think all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
Everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down

'Cause if you ever feel neglected
If you think all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

But if I was wrong
Then I'm sorry
I don't let it stand in our way

'Cause my head just aches
When I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done

But life is for living
We all know
And I don't wanna live it alone

Sing
Ah, ah, oh
Sing

And just sing
Ah, ah, oh 
Look at earth from outer space
Everyone must find a place
Give me time and give me space
Give me real, don't give me fake

Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me time, give us a kiss
Tell me your own politik

And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes

Give me one, cause one is best
In confusion, confidence
Give me peace of mind and trust
Don't forget the rest of us

Give me heart and give me soul
Wounds that heal and cracks that fix
Tell me your own politik

But give me love over, love over, love over this
I 
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah

And I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and under-prepared
But I wait for it

And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

Sing it please, please, please
Come back and sing to me
To me, me

Come on and sing it out, now, now
Come on and sing it out
To me, me
Come back and sing

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
Oh yeah


Where do we go? Nobody knows
I've got to say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line?
I've got to say I wasted all your time
Honey honey
Where do I go to fall from grace?
God put a smile upon your face, yeah

Ah, when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out I wanted to
Ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face ah yeah

Ah, when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out I want it to
Ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine

As good as mine, as good as mine
As good as mine, as good as mine

Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face 
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

You are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are

And nothing else compares
Oh nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are
You are

Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go 
To my surprise
And my delight
I saw sunrise
I saw sunlight

I am nothing
In the dark
And the clouds burst
To show daylight

Oooh, and the sun shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Oooh, and I realise
Who couldn't live without
Oooh, come apart without it

On a hilltop
On a sky-rise
Like a firstborn
Child

And at full tilt
And in full flight
Defeat darkness
Breaking daylight

Oooh, and the sun shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Oooh, and I realise
Who cannot live without
Oooh, come apart without
Daylight
Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

The green eyes
Yeah the spotlight
Shines upon you

And how could anybody
Deny you?

I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I met you

And honey you should know
That I could never go on
Without you

Green eyes

Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their mind

Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I met you

Honey you should know
That I could never go on
Without you

Green eyes, green eyes

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
A warning sign
I missed the good part, then I realised
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses

Come on in
I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

A warning sign
You came back to haunt me and I realised
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover

Come on in
I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

And I'm tired
I should not have let you go

So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms 
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face
Who remembers you when you are gone?

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me
When I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Night turns to day
And I still have these questions
Bridges will break
Should I go forwards or backwards?
Night turns to day
And I still get no answers

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face
Who remembers you when you are gone?

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me
When I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
He said, I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
He said, I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls

Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
Do back the things it did to you in return

Ah ah ah ah

He said, I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh and I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head

Honey
All the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on

He said, I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside me baby, watch the orange glow
Some will laugh and some just sit and cry
But you just sit down there and you wonder why

So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Oh to the head

Honey
All the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on
As you mean to go on

So meet me by the bridge
Oh meet me by the lane
When am I going to see
That pretty face again?

Meet me on the road
Meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
A rush of blood to the head
Come on, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
If I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

And time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
Oh, it's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to a noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets

Stood on the edge
Tied to a noose
And you came along
And you cut me loose

You came along
And you cut me loose
You came along
And you cut me loose
You're in control, is there anywhere you wanna go?
You're in control, is there anything you wanna know?
The future's for discovering
The space in which we're travelling
From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

Under the surface trying to break through
Deciphering the codes in you
I need a compass, draw me a map
I'm on the top, I can't get back

Whoa whoa

The first line on the first page
To the end of the last page
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
Oh, you just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

Is there anybody out there who
Is lost and hurt and lonely too
Are they bleeding all your colours into one?
and if you come undone
As if you've been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
Or if you're stuck in square one

What if there was no light
Nothing wrong, nothing right
What if there was no time
And no reason, or rhyme
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life
What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life

Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right
How can you know it, if you don't even try
Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right

Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
That's the risk that you take

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life
That you don't want me there by your side

Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right
How can you know when you don't even try
Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right

Oh - Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right,
Let's take a breath, jump over the side.
Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right,
You know that darkness always turns into light.
Ooh-ooh, that's right

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
And I want to feel like that
Little white shadows blink and miss them
Part of a system, I am

If you ever feel like
Something's missing
Things you never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system a plan

All this noise I'm waking up
All the space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted in a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you've seen it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
Don't you want to feel like that?
You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of a system a plan

All this noise I'm waking up
All the space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted in a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you've seen it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

Swim out on a sea of faces
The tide of the human races
An answer now is what I need
See it in the new sun rise and
See it break on your horizon
Oh come on love
Stay with me 
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face and I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Oh brother I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you, cause I don't know what to do
Oh brother I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh I wanna talk to you

You can take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how do you feel?
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done
Do something that's never been done

So you don't know where you're going, and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored
Nothing's really making any sense at all
Let's talk, let's ta-a-alk
Let's talk, let's ta-a-alk 
Trying hard to speak and
Fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
So part of the plan

When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way you can

I dive in at the deep end
She become my best friend
I wanna love you
But I don't know if I can

I know something is broken
And I'm tryna fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way I can

You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing

You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space

You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing 
How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where To, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know.
How long do I have to climb,
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

Look up, I look up at night,
Planets are moving at the speed of light.
Climb up, up in the trees,
every chance that you get,
is a chance you seize.
How long am I gonna stand,
with my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop,
before I see things the right way up.

All that noise, and all that sound,
All those places I got found.
And birds go flying at the speed of sound,
to show you how it all began.
Birds came flying from the underground,
if you could see it then you'd understand?

Ideas that you'll never find,
All the inventors could never design.
The buildings that you put up,
Japan and China all lit up.
The sign that I couldn't read,
or a light that I couldn't see,
some things you have to believe,
but others are puzzles, puzzling me.

All that noise, and all that sound,
All those places I got found.
And birds go flying at the speed of sound,
to show you how it all began.
Birds came flying from the underground,
if you could see it then you'd understand,
ah when you see it then you'll understand?

All those signs, I knew what they meant.
Some things you can invent.
Some get made, and some get sent,
Ooh?
Birds go flying at the speed of sound,
to show you how it all began.
Birds came flying from the underground,
if you could see it then you'd understand,
ah, when you see it then you'll understand? 
My song is love
Love to the loveless shown
And it goes on
You don't have to be alone
Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And it's so hard to see you clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say, "I don't mean that"
You're the target that I'm aiming at
Got to get that message home

My song is love
My song is love, unknown
But I'm on fire for you, clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say, "I don't mean that"
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

And I'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until it's much too late
On a platform I'm gonna stand and say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home

My song is love, is love unknown
And I've got to get that message home 
You see the world in black and white
No colour or light
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong. You might.

The sky could fall, could fall on me
The parting of the sea
But you mean more, mean more to me
Than any colour I can see

All you ever wanted was love,
But you never looked hard enough,
It's never gonna give itself up

All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry,
Nothing is as down or as up as us

You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
You should try

All you ever wanted was love,
But you never looked hard enough,
It's never gonna give itself up

All you ever wanted to be,
Living in perfect symmetry,
Nothing is as down or as up

Don't you want to see it come soon,
Floating in a big white balloon
Come give her your own silver spoon

Don't you want to see it come down?
There for throwing your arms around
And say "You're not a moment too soon."

Cause I feel low, cause I feel low
ooooh...
Yeah I feel low
oh no...oooh
Cause I feel low, cause I feel low
oh...
Yet I feel low
oh no...oooh
And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth
Silver-lining the cloud
Oh and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver-lining the clouds
Oh and I
Oh and I
I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do—it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part 
You cut me down a tree
And brought it back to me
And that's what made me see
Where I was going wrong
You put me on a shelf
And kept me for yourself
I can only blame myself
You can only blame me

And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
Or swallowed in the sea

You put me on a line
And hung me out to dry
And darling that's when I
Decided to go to see you

You cut me down to size
And opened up my eyes
Made me realize
What I could not see

And I could write a book
The one they'll say that shook
The world, and then it took
It took it back from me

And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
And you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea

Ooh...

And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

The streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

Oh what good is it to live
With nothing left to give
Forget but not forgive
Not loving all you see

Oh the streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well that's where I belong
And you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea

You belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
Yeah, you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea 
Sunlight, opened up my eyes
To see for the first time
You'll open them up
And tonight, rivers will run dry
And not for the first time
Rivers will run

Hundreds of years in the future
It could be computers
Looking for life on earth

Don't fight for the wrong side
Say what you feel like
Say how you feel

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go

Created, then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it
Someone will mess it up

And you are not wrong to
Ask who does this belong to
It belongs to all of us

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards, but then
you'll go forwards

You'll go backwards, but then
you'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards
Steal my heart and hold my tongue.
I feel my time, my time has come.
Let me in, unlock the door.
I've never felt this way before.

And the wheels just keep on turning,
The drummer begins to drum,
I don't know which way I'm going,
I don't know which way I've come.

Hold my head inside your hands,
I need someone who understands.
I need someone, someone who hears,
For you, I've waited all these years.

For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come.
Until my day, my day is done.
And say you'll come and set me free,
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me.

In your tears and in your blood,
In your fire and in your flood,
I hear you laugh, I heard you sing.
I wouldn't change a single thing.

And the wheels just keep on turning,
The drummers begin to drum,
I don't know which way I'm going,
I don't know what I've become.

For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come,
Until my days, my days are done.
Say you'll come and set me free,
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me.
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me.
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me. 

Are you running in a circle?
You can't be too careful
And you can't relate it
'Cause it's complicated
Oh you're gonna get it right some time
You're gonna get it right some time

It's how you see the world
How many times can you see?
You can't believe what you learn

It's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
Your not gonna get hurt

Oooohhhhh...

Is there something missing?
There's nobody listening
Are you scared of what you don't know?
Don't wanna end up on your own?
You need conversation
And information

Ohhhhhhhhh...

Gonna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

It's how you see the world
How many times have you heard?
You can't believe a word

It's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can learn

Oooooh
Oooooh
Ooooooooh

That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world 

At night they would go walking
'Til the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets they go searching
To see God in their own way
Save the night time for your weeping
Your weeping
Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
And the night over London lay

So we rode down to the river
Where Victorian ghosts pray
For their curses to be broken
We go wandering 'neath the arches
Where the witches are and they say
There are ghost towns in the ocean
The ocean
Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
And the night over London lay

God is in the houses
And God is in my head
And all the cemeteries of London
I see God come in my garden
But I don't know what he said
For my heart it wasn't open
Not open
Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
And the night over London lay
Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
There's no light over London today 
Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get
What I deserved
No better and no worse

I just got lost
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Ohhh and I'm...
Just waiting 'til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along will come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Ohhh and I'm...
Just waiting 'til the firing stopped
Ohhh and I'm...
Just waiting 'til the shine wears off

Ohhh and I'm...
Just waiting 'til the shine wears off
Ohhh and I'm...
Just waiting 'til the shine wears off 
Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well
Oh...

Time is so short and I'm sure
There must be something more

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head oh…
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well oh…

Time is so short and I'm sure
There must be something more

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Oh oh…

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head
Oh... 
Lovers keep on the road you're on
Runners until the race is run
Soldiers you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even the right is wrong

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
And I have no doubt
One day we're going to get out

Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Ohohohoh ohohohoh oh
Dreaming of when the morning comes

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
And I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out

Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer this heavy load
Locust wind
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner in a reign of love

Locust wind
Here I stop
How I wish I'd spoken up
To a reign of love

Reign of love by the church we're waiting
Reign of love on my knees go praying
How I wish I'd spoken up
Away get carried on a reign of love
When it started we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line
My back's on the ropes

When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool
Of us in daylight

There we were dying of frustration
Saying, "Lord lead me not into temptation"
But it's not easy when she turns you on
Sin, stay gone

If you'd only if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only God knows I'm trying my best
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness

Hey

So up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop then they let go
Dizzily screaming "Let the windows down"
As I crawl to the ground

If you'd only if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness 
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing,
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world 

It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow

Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below

When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me, won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God

Priests clutched onto Bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft

Bury me in armour
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

And if you love me, won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below

So if you love me, why d'you let me go?

I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still

Said if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know? 
They were sitting
They were sitting on the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious

They were sitting
They were talking under strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing

Cold, cold water bring me round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold, cold water what you say?
When it's such…
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait until the morning
Wouldn't wanna change a thing

People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away?
When it's such…
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

Ah-ah-ah-ah-iiiiii

Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

Now the sky could be blue
Could be grey
Without you I'm just miles away

Oh the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time All winter we got carried
Away over on the roof tops. Let's get married
All summer we just hurried
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry

So come over, just be patient, and don't worry

And don't worry

No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends

No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends

And in the end, we lie awake
And we dream of making our escape

And in the end, we lie awake
And we dream of making our escape

And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream
Of making our escape

And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream
Of making our escape

Ooh...

There's a wild wind blowing
Down the corner of my street
Every night there the headlights are glowing
There's a cold war coming
On the radio I heard
Baby it's a violent world

Oh oh love don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I could hear it coming
I could hear the sirens sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Time came a-creeping
Oh and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes on
Time'll leak and lead you on
Still it's such beautiful night

Oh oh love don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I could hear it coming
Like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Gravity release me
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground 

Scared of losing all the time
He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
The ripples and the lines
And he asked
"Will I see heaven in mine?"

That is just the way it was
Nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
Oh they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
The riddles and the rhymes
Will I see heaven in mine?
Oh oh oh oh I
Son don't ask
Neither half full or empty
Is the glass

Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast

So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Television selling plastic figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime
Stars in heaven align
Oh oh oh oh I
Son don't ask
Neither half full or empty
Is your glass

Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast

Oh what are we drinking when we're done?
Glasses of water 
Then there was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and green
Night is the bride of a lonely day
Time just floated
Then there was rain
The sound foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a pyramid tumbling
Time just floated away
We can watch it and stay
And we can listen

Oh rainy day come around
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
And oh but I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Then there was rain
I spent the night with the queen of Spain
My lonely little heart well it broke again
Time so vicious
The deeper that the knife goes in
The more you win
You end up with less than where you begin
The deeper that the knife goes in

Oh rainy day come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
We're separated now
And oh but I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

And I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house 
Smoke is rising from the houses
People burying their dead
I ask somebody what the time is
But time doesn't matter to them yet

People talking without speaking
Trying to take what they can get
I ask you if you remember
Prospekt, how could I forget?

Drums, here it comes
Don't you wish that life could be as simple
As fish swimming round in a barrel?
When you've got the gun

Oh and I run, here it comes
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get behind some kind of control
But I wasn't one

But here am I on my own in a separate sky
And here I lie on my own in a separate sky

I don't wanna die on my own here tonight
And here I lie on my own in a separate sky

Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better and no worse

I just got lost!
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along will come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost!
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting til the firing's stopped
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off


Yeah
...just waitin' til the... the... yeah
Aha, I got you, uh
With the same sword they knight you
They gon' good night you with
Shit, that's only half if they like you
That ain't even a half what they might do
Don't believe me? Ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac
See success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus
See success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed prepare to be crucified
Media meddles
Niggaz sue you, you settle
Every step you take
They remind you, you're ghetto
So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then you have to be Bobby now
And the question is, is to have had and lost
Better than not having at all?
Because I'm...

Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off 
Let me go boys, let me go
Push my boat from the highest cliff
To the sea below
Rocks are waiting boys
If rocks await
Swoop down from the sky and catch me like a bird of prey

Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime to be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Singing Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime to be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my feet won't touch the ground 
Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
"Do you ever get the feeling that you're missing the mark?"
It's so cold, so cold
It's so cold, so cold

Written up in marker on a factory sign
"I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine"
It's so cold, so cold
It's so cold, so cold

See the arrow that they shot, trying to tear us apart
Take the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let go of you, ooh-ooh

'Cause you do

Oh you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

On every street, every car, every surface, our name
Tonight the streets are ours
And we’re writing and saying
Don't let them take control
No we won't let them take control

Yes, I feel a little bit nervous,
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax,
How come they're out to get us?
How come they're out when they don't know the facts?

So on concrete canvas under cover of dark
On concrete canvas, I'll go making my mark
Armed with a spray can soul
I'll be armed with a spray can soul

You
Ooh-ooh

Oh, you
Ooh-ooh

'Cause you
You use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Woho-ooh
Woho-oooh

Yeah, It's true
When you
Use your heart as a weapon
That it hurts like heaven

It hurts like heaven

Oh it hurts like heaven 
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

And dream of
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh

Lalalalalalalalalalala
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, I know the sun must set to rise."

This could be
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

This could be
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

This could be
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh 
Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

Stole a key,
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet,
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free,
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene,
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me.

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

In my scarecrow dreams,
When they smash my heart into smithereens,
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete.
Be a cartoon heart,
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart.
We'll run wild,
We'll be glowing in the dark.

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

We'll be glowing in the dark.

All the boys, all the girls,
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls,
All the madness that occurs.
All the highs, all the lows,
As the room a-spinning goes
We'll run riot,
We'll be glowing in the dark.

Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

So we'll soar luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark. 
Oh morning come bursting the clouds, amen
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
Bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart she left a hole

The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties
The devil as he’s talking with those angel’s eyes
And I just wanna be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in

And sing slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

Like a river to a raindrop
I lost a friend
My drunken hazard Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do
Don't let go

And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
And lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain saying

Slow it down
Slow it down

Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world 
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favourite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

And we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

Oh
It was a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall
A wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall 
They got one eye watching you
One on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to

They got one eye watching you
One on what you do
So be careful what it is you're tryin' to do

And be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on you

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on…

They got one eye watching you
One on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true

D-d-don't believe a word
It's just us against the world
And we just gotta turn up to be heard

Hear the crocodiles ticking 'round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking 'round the world

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on you

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one

You could hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side fighting
While my left hides under the chairs

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on you

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Lord I don't know which way I am going
Which way the river gonna flow
It just seems that upstream I keep rowing
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

And that light hits your eye
I know, I swear,
We'll find somewhere the streets are paved with gold
Bullets fly, split the sky
But that's alright
Sometimes sunlight
Comes streaming through the holes

Oh, oh

Once upon a time somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I got to go, I got to go!

Once upon a time we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart
Oh, oh!

Oh

Once upon a time, we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on, and on and on and on

Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side, in the same game
And why'd you have to go, have to go and throw water on my flame?

I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
So it's over
This time, I know, it's gone
Saltwater
Tasted it too long
I only know I'm wrong
Now I know it's gone

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames

We have slowly gone

So it's over
This time you're flying on
This time I know no song
Can stop its lonely burn
Can stop it slowly going

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames

We have slowly gone

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames

We have slowly gone
Oh, we have slowly gone

Can't we pour some water on?
And if I lost the map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call

'When you're tired of racing
And you find you never left the start
Come on, baby, don't let it break your heart.'

Though heavily we bled
Still on we crawl
Try to catch a cannonball.
And a slow burning tide
Through my veins is flowing.
From my shipwreck I heard her call
And she said,

'When you're tired of aiming your arrows,
Still you never hit the mark
Even in your rains and shadows
Still we're never gonna part.
Come on, baby, don't let it break your heart.'

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let it break your heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let it break your heart

Don't let it break your heart 

You stole my star
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You stole my star
La, la la la la laaaaaa

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh, you really hurt me, oh
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh, you really hurt me 

I think of you
I haven't slept
I think I do
But, I don't forget
My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try my heart stays still
It never moves
Just won't be led

And so my mouth waters, to be fed
And you're always in my head

You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head

You're always in my head
Always in my...
Always in my...

This, I guess, is to tell you you're chosen out from the rest...
Call it magic
Call it true
Call it magic
When I'm with you
And I just got broken
Broken into two
Still I call it magic
When I'm next to you

And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't,
It's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't,
It's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't want anybody else but you

Ooooh ooh ooh

Call it magic
Cut me into two
And with all your magic
I disappear from view
And I can't get over
Can't get over you
Still I call it magic
You're such a precious jewel

And I don't, and I don't and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't,
It's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't,
It's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't want anybody else but you

Wanna fall
I fall so far
I wanna fall
I fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
I call it magic

Ooooh ooh ooh
Ooooh ooh ooh
Ooooh ooh ooh
Ooooh ooh ooh

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
Still believe in magic?
Oh yes I do
Oh yes I do
Yes I do
Oh yes I do
Of course I do 
Got a tattoo said 'together thru life'
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And you wonder when you wake up will it be alright, oh oh oh
Feels like there's something broken inside

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Got a tattoo and the pain's alright
Just want a way of keeping you inside

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colours and I'm dying of thirst
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Oh yeah yeah yeah
So much that it hurts
So much that it hurts 
For a second, I was in control
I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below would rise

And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let me go
But one last time

Tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Oh lie to me

Remember once upon a time
When I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine

So tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Oh lie to me
Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Oh lie to me
If you don't then lie
Oh lie to me

And call it true
Call it true love
Call it true
Call it true love
In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches, and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

Millions of miles from home
In the swirling, swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder but bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Used to be your arms around me
Your body on my body

When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms
Another's arms
When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Is there someone there to reach me?
Or someone there to find me?

When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms
Another's arms
And that's just torture to me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Pull yourself into me
Another's arms
Another's arms
When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Got to pull you close into me
Another's arms
Another's arms
Pull yourself right through me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Late night watching TV
Wish that you were here beside me
Wish that your arms were around me
Your body on my body 
Wait for your call, love
The call never came
Ready to fall up
Ready to claim
I'm ready for it all, love
Ready for the pain

Meet under sun and
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
The rain

Behind the walls, love
I'm trying to change
And I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for the change

Meet me in blue sky
Meet me again
In the rain
The rain
The rain
In the rain
The rain

Got to find yourself alone in this world
Got to find yourself alone
Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view 
On and on
You're told which side you're on
Ahh
You're forced you're thrown
To become the scythe to cut the corn

Ahh
And all your friends they ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset and away they go
All your friends they ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset and away they're thrown
Into the fire

Ten below
The call comes on the radio
Ahh
Over you go
And the red now all the rivers flow, the poppies grow

Ahh
All your friends they ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset and away they blow
And all your friends they ride into the sunset
Ride into the sunset and they're taken home
Open fire
Open fire

Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
Just to ride and fire 
Maybe I'm just a ghost
Disappear when anybody's close
Go through you when you try to hold
Try to hold me near

Maybe I'm just a ghost
Emptier than anybody knows
Maybe I'm on the ropes
Or I'm not even here

Every time I try to walk through walls
More walls appear
What's the point of feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point of tryna raise your voice
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

Maybe I'm a ghost
Just a whisper in a puff of smoke
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear

Or maybe I'm a ghost
Specter on a roller-coaster
Thorn without a rose
Something people fear

And every time I thought I'd walk through walls
It's all becoming clear
What's the point of feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point of saying 'Rescue me!'
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

And every time I thought I'd walk through walls
It's all becoming clear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear 
Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

Saying it's true
It's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams

And you get a head
A head full of dreams
You can see the change you want to
Be what you want to be

When you get a head
A head full of dreams
Into life I just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When you got me open handed
When you got me lost for words

I sing, oh-ohohoh
Oh-ohohoh
Oh-ohohoh repeats

A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams

Into life I just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams 
Been standing in the corner
Studying the lights
The dreaming of escape
Will keep you up at night

But someone had put the flare up
Got me in rays
So... I guess I better stay

"Uh uh, no come on!" you say

It's a fools gold thunder
It's just warning rain
Don't let the fears just start, what if
I won't see you again
Around here you never want to
Sleep all night

So start falling in love,
Start the riot
And come on rage with me

We don't need words
We'll be birds
Got to make our own key

Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing
But geography

Come on and raise it
Come on raise this noise
For the million people
Who got not one voice
Come on, it's not over!
If you mean it say loud
Come on, all for love
Out from the underground

Away with me
We don't need words
Close your eyes and see
We'll be birds
Flying free
Holding on in the mystery

Fearless through this you said
We'll go
Through this together ooohh
When you fly won't you
Won't you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think you're so cool 
Drink from me, drink from me
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Symphony
Then we'll shoot across the sky
We're on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Symphony
So high, so high
Then we'll shoot across the sky

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river, dried up
You came to rain a flood

And said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Woo!

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I, oh, I, oh, I
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

I, oh, I, oh, I
La la la la la la la
So high, so high
I, oh, I, oh, I
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...

Oh they say people come
Say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone
And the world may not know
Still I see you celestial

Like a lion you ran
A goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled
In perfect purple
So how come things move on
How come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world?
When I should but I can't let you go?

But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling within me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood
Sisters who ride
And we swore on that night
We'd be friends 'til we died
But the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you're with me
And the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
'Cause you give me this feeling, this everglow

What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow 

Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends every day
That's what she told me

Turn your magic on,
To me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on,
Not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

And I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Turn your magic on,
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape

If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh, then I
And if we've only got this life
You get me through

And if we've only got this life
In this adventure, oh, then I
Want to share it with you
With you
With you
Yeah I do
Woohoo
Woohoo
Woohoo

I know it's over before she says
I know it falls at the water face
I know it's over, an ocean awaits
For a storm
The sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over, a parting of ways
And it's done

But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
From the top of the world
Top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Now we're stopping the world, stopping its spin
Oh, come on don't give up
Don't see me give in
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh, didn't we have fun?

I know it's over before she says
Know someone else has taken your place
"I know it's over," Icarus says
To the sun
The sword sinks in, lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight 'til it's over,
Fight 'til it's done

But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
From the top of the world
Top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Now we're stopping the world, stopping in its tracks
But nothing's too broken to find a way back
Before it's over, before you run
Ah, didn't we have fun?

'Cause you and me
We were always meant to... always meant to be
We were always meant to... always meant to
You and me
We were always meant to... always meant to be

Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh, didn't we have fun?

But then...
Maybe we could again

This being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival

A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor

Welcome and entertain them all!
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide 
Been around the world, the wonders to view
Been around the world, looking for someone like you
Pyramids try, Babylon too
But the beautifullest treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I never say die, aim never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you

Been around the world, the universe too
Been around flying, baby, it's nothing I wouldn't do
Tanzaku stars, Lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you right
When the storm comes through

'Cause I never say die, aim never untrue
Never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah!

'Cause you reign, all 'cause you reign
All 'cause you reign
My army of one is gonna call it through

Sayin my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
It's my only weapon, army of one
Sayin my heart is my gun, army of one 

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Coming home and I'm finding no peace

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm out of luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know what you've got

I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

So I reach for it Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I reach for it

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been innocent but a sinner in me

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm not

I just put my hands up to the sky, I'm feeling like
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I just put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

So I reach for it Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I reach for it Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I reach for it And I know, and I know, and I know
So I reach for it I know what I've got
X marks the spot

I just put my hands up to the sky, I'm feeling like
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
We sat on a roof, named every star
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Hope has its proof put your hand in mine saying,
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design."

And time seemed to say,
"Forget the world and its weight."
And here I just want to stay

Amazing day
Amazing day

We sat on a roof, named every star
You showed me a place
Where you can be what you are

And the view, the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms I just want to sway

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

And I asked
Can the Birds in poetry, chime?
Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?
Oh, thanks God, must have heard when I prayed
'Cause now I always want to feel this way

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Yeah, today 

Because each has been sent as a guide

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up
Up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick on your orange field
Up and up
Up and up

See a pearl form a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood
It's in your blood

Underneath the storm, an umbrella is saying,
"Sitting with the poison takes away the pain."
Up and up
Up and up, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up
Up and up

How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart, oh

Yes, I wanna grow, yes, I wanna feel
Yes, I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up, oh

Try and see the forest, there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love
Just need love

When the going is rough, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

But you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say, "It's mine," and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

Up and up and up

Oh

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you're in pain, when you think you've had enough
Don't ever give up
Don't ever give up

Believe in love 
One, two, three

Fish fell out of water
Bird stuck on the ground
Chaos giving orders
Everything is upside down
The whole world on a flight path
Wonder where they'll go, ahhh
Troubles on the outside, I know

But now, all I can think about is you
All I can think about is you
If all that I'm on earth to do
Is solo
Then what a lone poor shoe
I wanna walk in a two

Go
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

When everything is falling all around you
It's all I can do
All I can think about is you
It's all I can
All I can think about is you
Love is the only thing left that's true 

My father said never give up son
Just look how good Cassius become
Muhammad, Mahatma, and Nelson
Not scared to be strong

I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say "Get outta here, kid, you got no future"?

Now you could run and just say they're right
No I'll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait they're wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long

My father said never give up son
Just look what Amelia and Joan done
Or Rosa, Teresa their war won
Not scared to be strong

Now you could run and just say they're right
No I'll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait, they're wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long

Yeah you could be someone special
You've got bright in your brains and lightning in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but I'm trying to turn k's to m's, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
Ah we on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve

Yeah you could be someone special
You've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

In you I see someone special
Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on and you can't go wrong

We were just about to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History has some to know
We were moving at the speed of flight

Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight

Just an alien

We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says

Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line

Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
For a lifetime

Just an alien
Moving target
Target movement
A patch, a corner
Of the spacetime
Just an alien
Turning toward it
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss

I want something just like this
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this 

Been rusting in the rubble
Running to a faint
Need a brand new coat of paint
I found myself in trouble
Thinking about what ain't
Never gonna be a saint

Saying float like an eagle
Fall like the rain
Pouring to put out the pain
Oh again and again

Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized

It's easy to be lethal
I'm learning from the news
It's a guidebook for the blues
Saying it's the very same steeple
People want to choose
They just see it from different views

And threading the needle
Fixing my flame
Oh now I'm moved to exclaim
Oh again and again

How I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I lift and I'm mesmerized

Oh again and again
Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I lift to a permanent high
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
It was dark
Now it's sunrise 

Stuck in a corner
Are monkeys in cages
That don't have a number
To fight one another
Try to recover

Climb up the ladder
Look up and you see birds
Blind as each other
How long can we suffer?
We're as blind as each other

On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer

Sisters and brothers
Who fight one another
Will mourn and deceive us
Will find us and keep us
Take us or leave us

How soon is now, yeah?
How long is never?
I'm nothing but normal
With something together
Come on and stick together

On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer 

She's gone 2000 miles
It's very far
The snow came down
Gets colder day by day
I miss her

I hear children singing
Felt like Christmastime

In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream... you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow... sparkle

Our hearts were singing
It felt like Christmastime

2000 miles
Is very far through the snow
I'll think of you
Wherever you go

2000 miles
It's very far through the snow
I'll think of you
Whenever you go

She's gone 2000 miles
It's very far
The snow came falling down
Gets colder day by day
I miss you

I hear people singing
It felt like Christmastime
I heard people singing
It felt like Christmastime
I heard people singing
It felt like Christmastime
I heard people singing
It felt like Christmas time 

They're calling you
Some kind of ghost
But I know that's not true

Cause time and time again I spoke
And I have spoke with you

They're saying I
Am some kind of ghost
But that's so hard to say

Maybe I'll go
Maybe you're safe

No there's no way to say...

And I would love you
To come over
And I would love you
Too

My song is love
My song is love, unknown
And it goes up
You don't have to be alone

My heavy heart
Looks like it's made of stone
But it's so hard to see, clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
Oh I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm not singing on my own

That bitter breeze
That bitter breeze has blown
Left me on fire, for you, clearly
Taken everything and gone
It’s taken everything I own

But I'm not gonna take it back
I’m not gonna say I don’t mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

I'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until it's much too late
On a platform I'm gonna stand and say
Oh I'm nothing on my own
Till that bitter breeze has blown

My song is love, is love unknown
And I’ve got to get that message home 

As far as I can see
All time and circuitry
Is wrong

As far as poetry
Sit down and sing to me
A song

'Cause all I want in this world
All I want in this world
Is for you to come home
A spell a rebel yell
A spell

Soldier come home to me
You've been away from me
So long
All I want in this world
All I want and deserve
Is for you to come home

A spell a rebel yell 

Animals we are
Disposable, collapsible and raw
In you go into some crowded room
And animals that climb
And they're climbing over you until you say
"Off you go, off you go"

Animal I am
And I'm looking for an answer just like you
But I should know which way to turn

An animal that runs
And I ran away from you because I'm scared
"Now off you go, off you go"

If you're gonna go, go now
If you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you how
So if you're gonna go
Go now

Animal you are
Disposable defenceless yes and
Watch your mouth, boys watch your mouth
An animal that runs
And I made all my excuses to you
And I missed my chance by a stones throw

If you're gonna go, go now
If you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you how
So if you're gonna go
Go now
Go now
Go now
Go now

And I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

Yes I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

Yes I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some heard the gun
Some bent the bow

Sometimes the wire must tense for the note
Caught in the fire, say oh
We're about to explode

Carry your world, I'll carry your world
Carry your world, I'll carry your world

Some far away
Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay
Heaven we hope is just up the road

Show me the way, Lord, 'cause I... I'm about to explode

Carry your world, I'll carry your world
Carry your world, I'll carry your world

Carry your world, and all your hurt.

People wanna fight for fun
But what is a battle when the war's already been won
People wanna break what's built
There's no use crying when the milk's already been spilt

Here's a needle, here's a thread
Sew yourself up, clear your head
Here's a needle, here's a thread
Oh no, I meant exactly what I said

You might find that you're useless
No better than a hole in the ground
You might find that you're useless
No better than a hole in the ground

Look at all the cavemen goin'
Turning over to the shore

I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution

Brothers and sisters unite
It's the time of your lives its the time of your lives
Break down, break down
Got to spread love around, got to spread it around

Brothers and sisters feel fine
It's the time of your lives, it's the time of your lives
There's no sound, no sound
Like this feeling you found like this feeling you found

But just stay down
Cause sometimes you feel
So stay down
And sometimes you feel
And it's me they're lookin' for
And it's me, I will never survive
But we'll be around some more

Brothers and sisters unite
It's the time of your lives, it's the time of your lives
Breakdown, breakdown
Got to spread love around, got to spread it all around

But just stay down
And sometimes you feel
So stay around
And sometimes you'll feel
And it's me they're looking for
And it's me, I will never survive
But well be around some more

It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright 

When you're sitting on a beach in a car with the paint dried up
Well, you're gonna give a cause when the rain washed up
Well being just there with the gypsy talking to my friend
But you'll never get with it if you don't get respect
Oh well you'll never get with it if you just want respect

But sometimes the money's gonna run out
And you'll be standing on the corner with a belly full of doubt
Sometimes somebodys gonna bring you down
And you'll be standing on your own with a bucket for a crown

Well me and the boys were standing thinking we were hip
I don't wanna be the captain of a sinking ship
Well me and the boys in a town where the mormon go
Listening to a session by noel Gallagher
I was listening to a session by noel Gallagher

They said sometimes your money's gonna run out
And you'll be standing on a corner with a belly full of doubt
Oh someday somebody's gonna bring you down
And you'll be standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown
Oh you'll be standing on a corner, just waiting on a corner
Standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown

I feel safe
I feel warm
When you're here, can I do no wrong?
I am cured, when I'm by you're side
I'm alright, yes I'm alright

I'm safe when I am with you
And I feel warm if you want me to
I am cured, when I'm by your side
I'm alright

Careful where you stand, my love
Careful where you lay your head
It's true we're always there
Looking out for one another

I feel safe when I'm with you
And I feel warm if you want me to
I am cured when you're all alone
I'm alright

So I'd like a quiet town, please
I'd like a quiet town

Oh now now
Oh now now
And careful where you stand
And careful where you stand

Christmas night,
Another fight,
Tears we cried,
A flood
Got all kinds of poison in, of poison in my blood

I took my feet
To Oxford Street,
Trying to right a wrong
"Just walk away," those windows say, but I can't believe she's gone.

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they flow
And I am up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hope

And like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Singing how I've always loved you, darling, and I always will

Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights, keep shining on

Those Christmas lights light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas lights, keep shining on

Oowwwhhhohooooowohohohoooo

Oh Christmas lights light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights keep shining on 

Well have you ever stopped to wonder how they do Christmas there down under?
How do they make Christmas nice, when they ain't got no snow and ice?
And what about poor Santa's sleigh?
He has to come from fucking miles away
And what about Mick Dundee?
Well he ain't got no Christmas tree

Well they say, Christmas here is so much fun
We got surfing, we got sun
Christmas here's sweet as a peach
Opening presents on the beach
We got barbies, we got beer
Santa wishes he lived here
Loads of laughter, loads of booze
Christmas with the kangaroos

Well have you ever stopped to wonder how they do Christmas there down under?
Have you ever stopped to think "Do they have much pumpkin drink?"
Oh don't you just find it shocking?
Have you got Tim Tams in your stocking?
Do you wonder where Jesus was born?
No, they got Kylie, they got Shane Warne

They all say Christmas here is so much fun
We got surfing, we got sun
Christmas here's sweet as a peach
Opening presents on the beach
Yeah 'cause got barbies, we got beer
Santa wishes he lived here
Loads of laughter, loads of booze
Christmas with the kangaroos

Loads of laughter, loads of booze
That's Christmas with the kangaroos

It could be worse
I could be alone
I could be locked in here on my own
Or like a stone that suddenly drops
It never stops, no

I could be lost
Or I could be saved
Calling out from beneath the waves
Beaten down by this ocean rain
Never again
Never again

Screaming out from the crests of waves

It could be worse
Bitter or sweet
It could be snapped from the jaws of defeat
Or like a light lit up on a beach
Wear your heart on your sleeve
Oh

You want to stop before you begin
You want to sink when you know you could swim
You want to stop just before you begin
Never give in
Never give in

Screaming out from the crests of waves

Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Except life and the love you make

Screaming out from the crests of waves

Screaming out from the crests of waves
You're longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves
You are longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves 

If sweet death should ever come for me
Let me know, boys, let me know
If you hear him coming, won't you let me flee
Let me go, boys, let me go

One day death is gonna conquer me
I'll be down where the water flows
I hope sweet heaven is the place for me
Let me know, boys, let me know

If sweet death should ever come for me
Take me down to some place below
If you hear him coming, won't you set me free
Let me go boys, let me go

If you hear him comin', won't you say for me
That I just don't want to go 

Oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh

So we left La Mancha
Heading out for higher plains
Me and Sancho Panza

Looking for adventure
Rocinante at the reigns
'Till the windmills answer

You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely ever again
You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely again
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

So they sent the doctor
For examining my brain
Said he's not too clever

When the world, when the world just seems
A little bit too cruel
Gonna leave it better
Gonna make one better, yeah!

So tell that princess
Tell that princess "hide down the drain"
Tell that princess she'll never be lonely again
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

Oooh
Oooh
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

Where the people sing
"Ole ole ole ole
Ole ole..."
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

Love, I hope we get on
I hope we can find a way
Seeing it all
Love, I hope we can be
I hope I can find a way
Of letting you see
That I'm so easy to please
So easy

Love, I hope we grow up
I hope we can find a way
Of seeing it all
Love, I hope we can be
I hope I can find a way
Of letting you see
That I'm so easy to please
So easy

Oh they say people come
They say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone
And the world may not know
Still I see you celestial
And I should but I can't let you go

But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling within me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood
Sisters who ride
Yeah, we swore on that night
We'd be friends 'til we died
But the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know you're always with me
And the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
That you give me this feeling, this everglow

What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you give me will everglow

God is watching me
God don't praise me because I beat Joe Frazier
God don't give nothing about Joe Frazier
God don't care nothing about England or America as far as real wealth… it's all His.
He wants to know how do we treat each other?
How do we help each other?
So, I'm going to dedicate my life to using my name and popularity to helping charities, helping people, uniting people
People bombing each other because of religious beliefs.
We need somebody in the world to help us all make peace.
So when I die – if there's a heaven – I'm gonna see it. 

If you're lost and feel alone
Circumnavigate the globe
All you ever have to hope for two

And the way you seem to float
Circumnavigate in hope
And they seem to lose control
With you

Ooh...

Everyone of us is hurt
And everyone of us is scarred
Everyone of us is scared
Not you

Your eyes closed
Your head hurts
Your eyes feel so low

Ooh...

Everyone of us is scared
Everyone of us is hurt
Everyone of us has hope

For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you 

Yesterday I woke up to the news
I was very very sad to hear
My favourite show would disappear, and
Today I'm filling up with blues
Though I'm happy that her tummy's growing
A DJ that we love is going

How'm I gonna make it from 10 through to 1?
And how'm I gonna tell her we'll miss her a tonne?
How to tell her thanks for the records she played?
Thanks for introducing us to Lana del Rey
Thanks for the stories and all the good times
Festival tales, Kilimanjaro climbs
Thanks for all the mornings, in the Lounge we'd arrive
And sweetly you'd tell us, "No swearing, we're live!"
Oh Fearne you made all of my mornings fly
Like the sun bursting through a cloudy sky
And you'll be great at anything that you wanna try
Now it's hard, but it's time for us to say goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye

Look how far the river took us.
How far the river took my son.
But the boats gone round the harbor,
And I gotta know the sinner
And I wait.

There's a boat going down the road and sea
A tumble will begin
Its the world you're living in.

The boat will sign the bottom,
And I hit down the button,
Oh, I can't describe the stage you put me in.
Oh, yeah.

And I'm so sorry,
I've been known to hurry
And baby I hope that I'm sorry
Cause tonight 

Baby
It's been a long time coming
Such a long, long time
And I can't stop running
Such a long, long time
Can you hear my heart beating?
Can you hear that sound?
'Cause I can't help thinking
And I won't stop now

And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
On everyone

Baby
When your wheels stop turning
And you feel let down
And it seems like troubles
Have come all around
I can hear your heart beating
I can hear that sound
But I can't help thinking
And I won't look now

And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone
On everyone
On everyone

On everyone
On everyone
On everyone

If you call and call
Your self esteem is low
And I heard you'd called
Is there no calling?
And away I go
Any way you go
I was o­n your tail
As clear as crystal

But it was harmless
It couldn't hurt you
Oh you were helpless
I know you'll get through
I know, I

Chemicals are cold
See you sit down o­n
A chemical you cause
Is like a crystal
So I heard you say
I got to get away
I'm o­n a second trail
As clear as crystal

But I was harmless
It couldn't hurt you
Oh you were helpless
I know you'll get through 

Stuck here, in the middle of nowhere
With a headache and a heavy heart
Well nothing was going quite right here
And I'm tired, I can't play my part

Come on, come on
Oh what a state I'm in
Come on, come on
Why won't it just sink in?

That help is just around the corner for us

Oh my head just won't stop aching
And I'm sat here licking my wounds
And I'm shattered but it really doesn't matter
'Cause my rescue is gonna be here soon

Come on, come on
Oh what a state, I'm in
Come on, come on
Why won't it just sink in?

That help is just around the corner for us
That help is just around the corner for us
Oh that help is just around the corner for us

I am dreaming of when I get back to Houston
I am dreaming of that fair and special place
I am dreaming of when Houston has no problems
In that city where they send you into space

I am dreaming of when I get back to Texas
Corpus Christi, Harris County, Galveston
There's a harmony that harms down there in Houston
Oh, Houston you got to keep on keeping on

From Miami we are sending love to Houston
We are praying that you make it through the rain
I know nothing's gonna break the will of Houston
Oh, and we can't wait to go down there again

I am dreaming of when I get back to Texas
Corpus Christi, Harris County, Galveston
There's a harmony that harms down there in Houston
Oh, Houston you got to keep on keeping on

Take it Jon!

Oh, Houston got to keep on keeping on
Yeah, Houston got to keep on keeping on 

They put the world in a tin can black market, contraband
And it hurt just a little bit, when they sliced and packaged it
In a long black trench coat two hands around the throat
Oh, you want to get it right sometimes

There's so much to be scared of and not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control? If your hear can you let me know
How can they invade it, when it's so complicated?
Oh, you just want to get it right sometimes
You just want to get it right sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times can you say, you can't believe what you learn
That's how you see the world, don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna give up, ooh

And there's something missing, seems like there's nobody listening
If you're running in a circle, how can you be too careful?
We don't wanna be man trapped, we don't wanna be shrink wrapped
Oh, we just want to get it right sometimes
We just want to get it right sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard, but you can't believe a word
That's how you see the world, but don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can hurt you, ooh, ooh, oh

That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world 

Darling, those tired eyes
Go with me all the time
And in the dead of night
Tell me you will be mine

Where do you go to, pretty babe?
Where do you go to when the night winds away?
Ask me so sweetly, what do I do?
And who do I sing for
Well honey I sing about you

You 

I ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And though I started here
I ran away from you

I'm gonna come on in
And see it through

I ran away from you
That's all I ever do

And when I heard you call to
Come back to me
And though I should stay
I don't have the stomach to

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool to mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do

I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
There might be nothing left to do
So I ran away from you

I'm gonna come on in
My eyes are closed

I can feel it there
The sun's so close
I'm gonna come on out
And burn the sky

A star arose in my own cage
I'm stuck in line
And in a cage

Just a single star
I sing for

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool to mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do

I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
And I did not know what to do
And so I ran away from you 

So I was an idiot
I was a god-damn idiot
Because I came here so violent
Because I came around here so violent

I said yes I was an idiot
I was a god-damn idiot
Because I made you think for it
Because I came round here to think for it

And sing it
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive

My love, my love, where have you been?
My love, my love, where did you go?
My love, my love, what have you seen?
My love, you're such an idiot

Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot

I was an idiot
I fell down like a god damn idiot
Because I came here to bring them down
Because I came round here to fight them down
I said yes I felt like an idiot
I was a god damn idiot

Sing it
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive

My love, my love, where have you been?
My love, my love, where did you go?
My love, my love, what have you seen?
My love, you're such an idiot

Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot

Listen now, it's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life

Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive 

There it started, came apart it, broke up into pieces and
There was a chance I missed it, it  so I put myself into your hands

Cause you're not just anyone, you're a ladder to the sun
Oh you're not just anyone, you're a ladder to the sun

And I could run my courses with opposing forces you said all men are mortals and,
So if you want me you can have me, take me baby grab me, yes if you want me you can have me

Cause you're not just anyone, you're a ladder to the sun
Oh you're not just anyone, you're a ladder to the sun

Oh now boy what you've been and done you set a course for a silver sun
Oh now boy what you've been and done

I had it all and I risked it a chance and I missed it
I had it all and, I risked it all,
Oh I risked it all

A ladder to the, a ladder to the sun,
A ladder to the, a ladder to the sun,
A ladder to the, a ladder to the sun,
I had it all and I risked it all,
A ladder to the, a ladder to the sun,
A ladder to the, a ladder to the sun,
A ladder to the, a ladder to the sun,
I had it all and I risked it all

From up above I heard
The angels sing to me these words.
And sometimes in your eyes
I see the beauty in the world.

Oh, now I'm floating so high.
I blossom and die.
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes,
Eyes

Sometimes the stars decide
To reflect in puddles in the dirt.
When I look in your eyes
I forget all about what hurts.

Oh, now I'm floating so high.
I blossom and die.
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
And cry.

Believe in miracles.

Oh hey, I'm floating up above the world now!
Oh hey, I'm floating up above the world now!

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah! 

Come on now, don't you want to see
This thing that's happening to me
Like Moses had power over sea
So you've got power over me

Come on now, don't you want to know
Cause you're a refuge, somewhere I can go
And you're air that, air that I can breathe
You're my golden opportunity

And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I

Come on now, don't you want to see
Just what a difference you've made to me
And I'll be waiting no matter what you say
And I'll keep waiting for days and days and days

And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I
I wish
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

If the sky's gonna fall down let it fall on me
If you're gonna break down you can break on me
If the sky's gonna fall down let it fall on me
Oh, let it fall on me


Somewhere up above the stars
The wreckage of a universe floats past
Somewhere up above my heart
A tiny little seed is sown, a government is overthrown,
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last

And I heard it on the radio that one day we'll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a TV show that somewhere up above and in my heart
They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars
We won't see the earth again
And the seconds just remain unchanged

8 to 9, 9 to 10
We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again, you and me
We are meeting for the first time can't you see
7 6 5 4 3
We are meeting for the first time
Singing this space symphony

They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars,
Past the satellites and stars, they're moving us to Mars 

Murder coming to get us
Yeah coming to get us and away we hide
Murder, see it all around us
See it all around us
And away we hide

Murder coming to get us
They're coming to get us
And away we hide
Away we hide

Tie me to a tree
Tie my hands above my head
Sing a song to me
Sing a song like what you said

And they're gonna murder me
They're gonna take me down
Even before I sleep
I cry murder

Come spit at us
Come and throw your weight around
Come and fight with us
Try and knock us to the ground

'Cause they're gonna murder me
They're gonna take me down
Even before I sleep
I scream murder
Murder

Oh now what can it possibly gain?
Oh what can it possibly gain?
Oh now what can it possibly gain?
Oh yeah what can it possibly gain?

Cry murder, murder
I cry murder

Murder I'm coming to get us
I'm coming to get us
And away we hide
Murder, see it all around us
See it all around us
And away we hide
Murder coming to get us
It's coming to get us
And away we hide
Murder, see it all around you
See it all around you
And away we hide 

Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep,
And I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me,

But I wake up,
Yes I wake up,
Smiling.

Sometimes I feel that the chance is surprising,
Surprisingly good to be moving around,

So I wake up,
Yes I wake up,
Smiling

So what? I feel fine,
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life,
I'm alright, I feel good,

So I'll do, I'll try to stop moving,
Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep,
And I've got to get going so much that I wanted to do,

Yes I wake up,
Smiling.

And this could be my last chance,
This may be my only chance,
Yeah this could be my last chance,
No more keeping my feet on the ground.

Sometimes I feel that the chance is surprising,
Surprisingly good to be moving around,

And I move,
And I wake up,
Smiling

So what? I feel fine,
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life,
I'm alright, I feel good,
So I'll do, well it's time to stop moving.

And this could be my last chance,
This may be my only chance,
Yeah this could be my last chance,
No more keeping my feet on the ground.

There's nothing to keep me,
Nothing to keep me
Back 

Here's an Ode, ah, to deodorant
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene
It keeps me through the day

Another ode, ah to deodorant
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene
It's the confidence I need

It's medicine for the soul
It's medicine for the mind
It picks me up and makes me whole
It makes me feel alright

Here's an Ode, an ode to aerosol
It's my thing
Ah, it's my favourite hygiene, it's the confidence I need

It's medicine for the soul
It's medicine for the mind
It picks me up and makes me whole
It makes me feel alright

It's okay Oh, would I ever let you down? No way
Oh, would I ever let you down, okay?
Oh, would I ever let you down, no way
Oh, would I ever let you down...

I'll never let ya, I'll never let ya, I'll never let you down, no way

Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way

Could you, could you come back
Come back together
Put yourself on the band
And see us forever

Could you, could you come home
Come home forever
Surely things in the band
Keep us together

Cause you're the one I love
You're the one I love
You're the one I love
Ahhhh, ahhhh

Could you, could you come home
Could you tell me whatever
Tie youself to a mast
It's now or it's never
Could it tear us apart
It'll soon be forever
It's gonna tear us apart
Keep us together

You're the one I love
You're the one I love
Ahhh ahhh
You're the one I love
Yeah yeah you're the one

Oooooo...
Oooooo...

You're the one I love
You're the one I love
You're the one I love 

The cardboard head I see
Has found its way to me
Its out and its out and its out
Making me cry
I sleep but I will not move
I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated, oh no

What if cars don't go my way
And its sure to spoil my day?
But in voices loud and clear you say to me;
"Its only superstition
Its only your imagination
Its only all the things that you fear
And the things from which you can't escape"

Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others
Oh no


And its making me cry, and its making me cry
And I'm slipping away, I'm slipping away

Its only superstition, only your imagination
And its only superstition, only superstition.

Poor me, I'm floating out to sea
An opportunity that went by
Poor you, oh what you gonna do
No what you gonna do, you just cry

Oh, you always come undone
Try into the sun, you don't know why
Poor you, I know what you gonna do
Come on love I'll see it through, I don't know why

I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand

Poor me, now float me out to sea
Oh no just let it be, come on try
Poor you, oh what you gonna do
Oh what you gonna do, you just cry

I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand

I don't understand
I don't understand

Oooh, ahhhh, ahhhh

Once upon a time, somebody ran,
Somebody ran away saying "Fast as I can,
I got to go, I got to go"
Once upon a time, we fell apart,
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart,
Oh whoa, oh whoa

Could've been a princess, you'd be a king,
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go,
Could've been a princess, you'd be a king,
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go,

You stole my star,
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
You stole my star
La la la la la la

Whoa, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Once upon a time, we were burning bright,
Now all we ever seem to do is fight,
On and on, and on and on and on
Once upon a time, on the same side,
Once upon a time, on the same side,
In the same game
And why'd you have to go?
Have to go and throw water on my flame?

Could've been a princess, you'd be a king,
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go,
Could've been a princess, you'd be a king,
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go,

You stole my star,
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
You stole my star
La la la la la la

Whoa, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh

'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me,
'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me,
'Cause you really hurt me, oh
You really hurt me, oh
'Cause you really hurt me, oh
You really hurt me

So I waited for you
What wouldn't I do?
And I'm covered, it's true
I'm covered in you

If I ever want proof
I find it in you
Yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

Light and dark
A bright spark
Light and dark
And then, light

So I waited all day
What wouldn't I say?
And are there things in your way?
Things happen that way

Oh

And if I ever want proof
Then I find it in you
Oh
Yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

Light and dark
A bright spark
Light and dark
And then, light
Light
Light
Light
Light 

Climb up your mountain
Nineteen and countin'
You have got seven, I have got one

Blinded and hurtin'
This I'm deserving
I've got my secrets
You've only got the sleeping sun

When you've got a secret
Then you've got to keep it
When you've got a question
Answers will come

Running and hiding
Take and dividing
You've got your secrets
I've only got a sleeping sun

Sleeping sun
Singing
Oooh um
Ohhhh oh...
Ahhh ahh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh ohh

And you, as I, saw
A piece in a jigsaw
Run up and around it and
Jump up real tall

Run round the houses
North and the souths'
You've got your answers we've
Only got a sleeping sun

Sleeping sun
Singing
Oooh um
Ohhhh oh...
Ahhh ahh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh ohh

I went digging for gold
I went down to the valley
Over by the mountain
Where the prospektor had been told
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

I went digging for gold
I went down with my brother
A bucket and a shovel
and a book about the colour of coal
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying what use the metal if the metal don't shine?
She said bring me back a ring cause I really want one
Now I been digging so long that I never seen the sun

I went digging for gold

Saying what use the metal if the metal don't shine?
She said bring me back a ring cause I really want one
Now I been digging so long that I never seen the sun
Now I been digging so long that I never seen the sun
again..one last time
Now I been digging so long that I never seen the sun 

There's a man who swears he's God
But I'm pretty sure he's not
There's a man who walks around
Like he owns the fucking lot

There's a man who takes his time
From the hands of a cuckoo clock
You can hear him walk around
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock

At first, it was easy
But now why's it have to be so hard?
Heaven is a fire escape
You try to cling to in the dark

At first it was simple
But now it got too complicated
But the world just got a lovely time
Or blame it all on my mistake

Maybe I'll find heaven
One day, after dark
Maybe you'll find heaven is a place to part?

We are doing everything we can
We still can't seem to switch it on
I am floating up beneath the clouds

X and Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
That and this
We're part of a bigger plan
Don't know what it is
Don't know what it is

You and me
The land, sun, trees, the sky, the stars, the sea
365 degrees
I am a puzzle, you're the missing piece
Hang on a minute, just a minute, please
I'll come
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm
Hide and sob, and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

X is Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
365 degrees
All of the surface and the underneath
Searching your mellow and outsings your key, ah
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm
Hide and sob, and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

And you don't know that you've been born
Can't see the calm until the storm
Can't tell your right side from your wrong
Can't see the wave you're riding on 

How tides control the sea
And what becomes of me
How little things can slip out of your hand

How often people change
No two remain the same
Why things don't always turn out as you planned

These are things that I don't understand
Yeah these are things that I don't understand

I can't and I can't
Decide
Wrong oh my wrong
From right
Day oh my day
From night
Dark oh my dark
From light
I love but I love
This life

How infinite is space
And who decides your fate
Why everything will dissolve into sand

How to avoid defeat
Where truth and fiction meet
Why nothing ever turns out as you planned

These are things that I don't understand
Yeah these are things that I don't understand

I can't and I can't
Decide
Wrong oh my wrong
From right
Day oh my day
From night
Dark oh my dark
From light
I love but I love
This life. 

Wise men say
Looks like rain today
Crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the steepy subway trains
Heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moon's bright
Starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something's happened
It's so strange this feeling

Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says:
"Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?"

Wise men say
Looks like rain today
Crackled on the speakers
Trickled down the sleepy subway trains
Heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

We all fall in love sometimes
We all fall in love sometimes
We all fall in love, sometimes

It's been a night
Such a night
Such a long night
Watch myself disappear
Into the wild side
Said good bye to hard side
Sang, saw a jackal appear

Every road, that's wrong
Seems like the road, I'm on
Every sign just seems unclear
Won't you come switch me on
Don't know where I've gone
And I, I wish I was here

In a fight, such a fight
You love our fight
I'm not lying, this I swear
The demons that hide inside
To the wild, why am I tired
How come I'm never there

Every road, that's wrong
Seems like the road, I'm on
Every sign just seems unclear
Won't you come switch me on
Don't know where I've gone
And I, I wish I was here

And I, I wish I was here
And I, I wish I was here

I slipped away last night
Took me away from sight and the place I know

All crushed upon my skin
This mess I put you in and the punch I thrown

It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain on side

And in a chain reaction
I was down and calling for a place to hide

I saw a broken arm
Machines will all break down in the way I know

Mended and all made clean
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw

It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain so sure

And in a chain reaction
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl
